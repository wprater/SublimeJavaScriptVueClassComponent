# Sublime JavaScript Vue Class Component Syntax

You can install this package using package control and [adding a repository manually](http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/08/install-sublime-packages-from-github.html).

The purpose of this syntax definition is to highlight tempates in the [Vue Class Component](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component) decorator as HTML.  It will inherit the rest of the source.js scope from the [Babel Sublime package](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime).
